Discriminative predicate path mining for fact checking in knowledge graphs, B Shi, T Weninger, Knowledge-Based Systems 104, 123-133, 2016

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.05911.pdf

```
Pre-requisite for Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nddsg/KGMiner.git
cd KGMiner/.
./compile.sh
```

When itâ€™s done, run
```bash
./run_server.sh
```
to start a server instance

when you see the server is started (you should see the following output)

```
Load 4743012 nodes
Load 671 rels
Load 27313477 edges with 671 relations
4218123 out of 4743012 have valid entity label
3313257 out of 4218123 have more than one entity label
Graph constructed
50 threads are created
```

Then open a new command line, run
```bash
./run_test.sh
```

You will see some outputs that like
```
